# Chatbots

My WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge project.

This playground allows you to create a chatbot. In first part, you can learn basics about my playground, edit a chatbot's details (name and profile picture) and add specific questions to chatbots. In second part, you can create a chatbot with custom name, profile picture and questions.

# Usage

* Download and unzip the Chatbots.playgroundbook.zip file.
* Open Chatbots.playgroundbook in Swift Playgrounds. (macOS recommed)
