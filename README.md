# Chatbots

My WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge project.

This playground allows you to create a chatbot. In first part, you can learn basics about my playground, edit a chatbot's details (name and profile picture) and add specific questions to chatbots. In second part, you can create a chatbot with custom name, profile picture and questions.

## Usage

* Download and unzip the Chatbots.playgroundbook.zip file.
* Open Chatbots.playgroundbook in Swift Playgrounds. (macOS recommed)

## Credits

* I used this [blog post](https://www.iosapptemplates.com/blog/swiftui/swiftui-chat) to create chat view of this playground.
